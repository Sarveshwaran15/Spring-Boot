🔹 Spring Boot JDBC Layered Architecture

1️⃣ Model Layer (Entity)
Represents the data structure of your table.
Typically a POJO (Plain Old Java Object).
Does not require annotations like @Entity (since we are using JDBC, not JPA).

2️⃣ Repository (DAO) Layer
Handles direct communication with the database.
Uses JdbcTemplate to perform queries.

3️⃣ Service Layer
Contains business logic.
Calls the repository layer for database operations.

4️⃣ Controller Layer
Handles HTTP requests.
Calls the service layer to process data.
